	Given three ints, first, second, third, return true if second is greater than first, and third is 
	greater than second. However, with the exception that if the parameter "itsOk" is true, 
	second does not need to be greater than first but still better be less than third.


	 EXPECTATIONS:
		isOrdered(1, 2, 4, false)   --- true
		isOrdered(1, 2, 1, false)   --- false 
		isOrdered(1, 1, 2, true)    --- true
